# Sequence_to-Sequence_Models
This projects is an implementation in Pytorch of Sequence-to-Sequence models through LSTM network and Attention Mechanisms. Dataset used is Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus that basically consists in pairs of dialogs from different movies conversations. The model is trained on preprocessed data to generate its own conversation pairs.
